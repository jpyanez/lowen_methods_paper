This is the LaTeX repository for a paper related to the methods and techniques from mostly DeepCore and low-energy physics analyses. The bulk of the latex skeleton is taken from the PINGU LoI and the DeepCore Performance paper.

The top directory, where this README file is located, contains two .tex
files, NewCommands.tex and Main.tex.

NewCommands.tex is where you should go to put in new commands like

\providecommand{\nue}{\nu_{\rm e}}

so that in everyone's .tex file, instead of $\nu_e$ in one place and
$\nu_{\rm e}$ in another, everyone uses $\nue$.  Note that we use
\providecommand instead of \newcommand because the former works
even if the file NewCommands.tex is loaded twice.

If you want to build the entire document, run:

pdflatex Main

Each subdirectory contains the following:
- a .tex file with the source latex
- a figures/ subdirectory to house all the figures
- .sty and .cls files for the "subfiles" package

You can build a single section of the document without having to build
the entire document (that way other people's latex errors in other sections
will not slow you down) by running (from, e.g., the Introduction/ subdir):

pdflatex Introduction

This will build a pdf file for just Introduction.tex and nothing
else.  The same file NewCommands.tex in the top directory will be \input
regardless of which subdirectory you happen to be working in, provided
your .tex file follows the format shown in the *_outline.tex file in each
subdirectory.
